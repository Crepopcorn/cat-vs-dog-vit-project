Accuracy	Vit-l16>Vit-b16>Vit-l32>Vit-b32
	
	Large model of vision transformer has better accuracy than base model (same image patch size)
	Vision Transformer with image patch size of 16 more accurate than with with image patch size of 32
	
Loss	Vit-l16<Vit-b16<Vit-l32<Vit-b32
	
	Large model of vision transformer has less loss than base model (same image patch size)
	Vision Transformer with image patch size of 16 less loss than with with image patch size of 32
	
	Thus, to achieve better result, use large model with fewer image patch size
